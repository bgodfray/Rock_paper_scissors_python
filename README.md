# Rock Paper Scissors Python Project
The development of my Rock Paper Scissor game made in Python starting on Stanford Code in place to Pygame.

The game developed is a game that has 3 game options. 
1) Rock, Paper, Scissors.
2) Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. (Based on Big Bang Theory Game)
3) Cat, Mouse, Elephant. (which is a child friendly version of Rock, Paper, Scissors).

##-Stanford Code in place version 1

This code is to be run on the code in place environment.

The version of the game allows you to select one of the 3 games with the choice of playing 1, 3 or 5 rounds.

The game shows a graphic for each round based on the choices and it accounts for invalid input.

##-Python version 2

Code written in Visual Studio Code
Same code as the 'Stanford Code in place' version and runs in the python environment

##-Pygame version 3

Code written in Visual Studio Code
Revised code to run in Pygame with a game window. 
The version of the game allows you to select one of the 3 games with the choice of playing 1, 3 or 5 rounds.
Coding for this version was learned from the following youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geE6vDfOlHY and then amended with my own option from reading the pygame manual.
The game has a 5 second countdown for the player to make their choice. If the player fails to pick an option they lose that round. There is also has music on the menu and a wining and losing tune.
