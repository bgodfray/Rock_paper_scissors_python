# Rock Paper Scissors Python Project
The development of my Rock Paper Scissor game made in Python starting on Stanford Code in place to Pygame

The game developed is a game that has 3 game options. 
1) Rock, Paper, Scissors.
2) Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock (Based on Big Bang Theory Game)
3) Cat, Mouse, Elephant (which is a child friendly version of Rock, Paper, Scissors)

-Stanford Code in place version 1

This code can be run on the code in place environment.

-Python version 2

Same code as the 'Stanford Code in place' version and runs in the python environment

-Pygame version 3

Revised code to run in Pygame with a game window. This version also has music added to it.
